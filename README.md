# My .vimrc

I learned Vim a handful of years ago in one of my classes. Since then, I've gotten pretty comfortable with the basic workflow. For most of my heavy duty work up until now, though, I've been using VSCode with Vim keybindings. I always thought, however, that I was still a lot more comfortable in Vim alone -- I just didn't have all the features I was using there.

This is my attempt to get all the functionality I need while coding in Vim. To do so, I've leveraged the following
* Neovim instead of Vim :)
* Vim-Plug as my plugin manager
* Usually running Vim inside of tmux
I've tried finding the most effective tools for what I'm looking for, and grabbing things I like from other configurations (e.g. the logo from DOOM emacs), but this is only part of the way there ... for now.
